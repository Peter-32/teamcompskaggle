2 tanky is just right
1 duelist is best
1 support is okay
at most 3 glass cannons
0 tanks is fine
0 assassins is best
more early game power is good
low middle game power is good; not too much
more late game power is also good


12+ is high power; 11- is low power
Check what mix is best for early/late split



HUGE boost if delta is high!!

4+ Delta is huge win rate
